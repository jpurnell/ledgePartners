We are always on the lookout for undergraduate or graduate students interested in joining our team on a part-time or full-time basis. While we cannot offer paid internships at this time, we can offer you opportunities to learn about small business acquisitions and gain mentorship in the fields of investment banking, consulting and startups through an unpaid internship. You'll spend your time searching for acquisition opportunities and helping us with operational and financial diligence of small businesses. If you are interested, reach out below and we'd love to chat!
