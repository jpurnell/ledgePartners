This document explains the online privacy practices and policy of Ledge Partners (“Ledge Partners”) for its website at www.ledgepartners.com. In general, you remain anonymous when visiting the website. Ledge Partners does not collect personal data from visitors to the website, and therefore does not convey any personal data to third parties. The website does not use “cookies” (small strings of data sent to visitors’ computers to uniquely identify the computers to the web-server).

If you contact Ledge Partners by e-mail (through a hyperlink on a webpage, or otherwise), then we naturally will have your name, e-mail address, and any information in your message. We will use this information only to reply to your message.

Visitors also may send resumes and applications for employment to us through the website. Information in those documents will be used only to process the applications. Ledge Partners may investigate statements in resumes and applications to evaluate candidates for employment.

Ledge Partners endeavors to provide a secure website, but cannot guarantee the confidentiality of electronic communication. Transmissions to and from the website are not encrypted, nor are e-mail messages. Accordingly, you should carefully consider whether to submit sensitive information that you would not want made public, and should recognize that your use of the website is solely at your own risk.

This website may contain links to other websites. Ledge Partners is not responsible for their privacy practices or content. Ledge Partners may change the features and content of the website. This policy may change accordingly. If our practice of not collecting personal data changes, we will give you the option to have the data used solely for the purpose for which you provided it. You should periodically revisit this webpage to familiarize yourself with our current policy. By visiting this website, you agree to be bound by the then-current policy.

Nothing in this policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Ledge Partners to transfer all or part of its business or assets (including this website, and any personal data collected under an applicable revised policy) to an affiliate or independent third party, at any time, for any reason.

If you believe that Ledge Partners has acted inconsistently with this policy, please notify us at the address below. We will respond to your concerns, and take remedial action, if appropriate.

If you have questions or comments about this policy or the practices of the website, you may contact Ledge Partners via the [Contact Us](/contact-us) page on the Site.
